The purpose of this exercise was writing a program that could read
the contents of a .txt file, and guess if the text was written in
english, german, french or swedish. 

A histogram was provided, the rest is my own solution. It displays
how similar the input text is to each of the languages, and also
the frequency of each of the letters in the alphabet.
