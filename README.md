# Cpp_exercises
My (more advanced) projects for a class in C++. We were required to write our programs in one file only. Use of vectors etc. was forbidden for the purpose of properly learning arrays, pointers and garbage collection.

Unfortunately many of the code comments as well as the interface of the programs are written in swedish.
